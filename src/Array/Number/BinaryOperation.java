/*
      3. Write a function Calculate Binary Operations(str) that accepts the string as an
      argument or parameter. The string should contain the binary numbers with their operators
       OR, AND, and XOR?
       a. A Means the AND Operation.
       b. B Means the OR Operation.
       c. C Means the XOR Operation.
       By scanning the given string from left to right you've to calculate the string and
       by taking one operator at a time then return the desired output.
       Conditions:
       1. The priority of the operator is not required
       2. The length of the string is always Odd
       3.If the length of the string is null then return -1.
       Sample Test Case:
       Input:
       1C0C1C1A081
       Output :
       1
